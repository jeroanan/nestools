This project is now working towards creating a basic (at first) nes emulator. 

Currently working on the 6502 processor, one instruction at a time. For each instruction this will involve:

1. Write instruction code
2. Write unit tests to prove that instruction works

..but not necessarily in that order, depending on how much I want to be a nice TDD boy at a given moment.

Further work to be decided once I've got all/a good amount of the 6502 instructions implemented.
