This project is now working towards creating a basic (at first) nes emulator. 

Currently working on the 6502 processor, one instruction at a time. For each instruction this will involve:

1. Write unit tests to prove that instruction works
2. Write instruction code

OpCodes are to be implemented using a TDD-type approach; tests will be written before the OpCodes are implemented. OpCodes themselves can then be implemented at any time after their respective unit tests have been completed.

Further work to be decided once I've got all/a good amount of the 6502 instructions implemented.
